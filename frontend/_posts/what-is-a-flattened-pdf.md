You may have heard the term "flattened PDF" but might not be sure what it means. In simple terms, flattening a PDF merges all its interactive elements—like form fields, annotations, and signatures—into a single, static layer. Essentially, it's like printing your interactive document to a new, non-editable file.

This guide will explain the benefits of flattening a PDF and show you how to do it in seconds.

## Why Flatten a PDF?

Flattening a PDF is a crucial step for finalising documents for several reasons:

- **Security:** It prevents others from editing the information you've entered into form fields or from moving your digital signature.
- **Printing Compatibility:** Flattening ensures that all annotations, comments, and form data will print correctly, as some printers can't process interactive layers.
- **Archiving:** A flattened PDF is a final, "as-is" version of a document, perfect for record-keeping.
