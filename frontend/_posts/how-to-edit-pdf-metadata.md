Every PDF file contains hidden information called "metadata," which includes details like the document's Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords. This information is important for organization, searchability, and professional presentation. Sometimes, you need to update this data, especially if it's incorrect or was automatically generated.

This guide will show you how to view and edit your PDF's metadata in a few simple steps, using a secure, browser-based tool.

## Why Edit PDF Metadata?

Updating a file's properties is useful for several reasons:

- **Professionalism:** Ensuring the "Author" field correctly credits the creator of the document.
- **Organization:** Using the "Title" and "Subject" fields to accurately describe a file's contents, making it easier to manage.
- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** For PDFs hosted online, descriptive metadata can help search engines understand and rank your document.
- **Correcting Errors:** Removing or changing default information left by the software that created the PDF (like "Microsoft Word - Document1").

## How to Edit Metadata in 3 Steps

The **A2Z Tool** platform provides a free and private way to edit your PDF's properties.

1.  **Upload Your PDF:** Go to our [Edit PDF Metadata tool](/en/edit-metadata) and upload your file. Because the tool runs in your browser, your file is never sent to our servers.
2.  **View and Edit:** The tool will automatically read and display the current metadata in a form. You can type directly into the fields for Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords to make your changes.
3.  **Save and Download:** Click the "Save Changes & Download" button. A new version of your PDF with the updated metadata will be generated for you to download instantly.

Editing your PDF's metadata is a small but important step in professional document management, and with the right tool, it's a quick and easy process.
