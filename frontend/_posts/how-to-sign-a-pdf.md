Signing documents digitally has become a standard practice for everything from employment contracts to lease agreements. Instead of the cumbersome process of printing, signing, and scanning, you can now add your signature to a PDF directly from your computer.

This guide will show you how to create and add a legally binding electronic signature to any PDF for free, with a focus on keeping your signature and your documents secure.

## Why Sign a PDF Online?

- **Speed and Efficiency:** Sign and return a document in minutes, not hours or days.
- **Environmentally Friendly:** Saves paper and ink by eliminating the need to print.
- **Professionalism:** A clean, digital signature looks more professional than a low-quality scan.

## How to Sign a PDF in 5 Steps

The **A2Z Tool** platform provides a free and highly secure tool for signing documents. Your signature and your files are never uploaded to our servers.

1.  **Upload Your PDF:** Go to our [Sign PDF tool](/en/sign) and upload the document you need to sign.
2.  **Create Your Signature:** Click "Create Signature." You have two options:
    -   **Draw:** Use your mouse or touchscreen to draw your signature directly on the screen.
    -   **Upload:** Select an image file (JPG or PNG) of your existing signature from your computer.
3.  **Place Your Signature:** Click "Place on Page." Your signature will appear on the document.
4.  **Position and Resize:** Drag the signature to the exact spot where it needs to go (e.g., on the signature line). You can also drag the corners to make it larger or smaller.
5.  **Apply and Download:** Once you're happy with the placement, click "Apply Signatures & Download." A new PDF with your signature permanently embedded will be created for you to save.

This process provides a fast, free, and secure way to handle all your document signing needs.
