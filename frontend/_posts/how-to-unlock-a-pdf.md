Password-protected PDF files are great for security, but they can be a hassle when you need to access a document frequently or share it with others who don't need the protection. Removing a password you already know is a simple way to make your file more accessible.

This guide will show you how to securely remove the password from any PDF file, right in your browser.

## When Do You Need to Unlock a PDF?

- **Convenience:** To open a frequently used document without having to enter the password every time.
- **Sharing:** To share a document with a group of people without having to also share a sensitive password.
- **Editing:** Some PDF tools cannot edit or modify a file until the password protection is removed.

**Important Note:** This tool is for removing a password that you **already know**. It cannot be used to crack or bypass an unknown password.
