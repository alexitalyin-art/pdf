Filling out PDF forms is a common task for everything from job applications to official paperwork. While some PDFs have interactive fields, many are "flat" and don't allow you to type in them. Fortunately, you don't need expensive software to get the job done.

This guide will show you how to easily fill out any PDF form directly in your browser, for free.

Using an online tool to fill forms offers several advantages:

- **Convenience:** No need to print, fill by hand, and then scan the document. You can do it all digitally.
- **Professionalism:** Typed text is cleaner, more legible, and looks more professional than handwritten responses.
- **Accessibility:** You can fill out a form from any computer with a web browser, without needing to install special software like Adobe Acrobat.
