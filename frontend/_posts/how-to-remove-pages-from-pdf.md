This guide will show you how to securely remove pages from any PDF file, right in your browser, without needing to install any software.

## Why You Might Need to Remove PDF Pages

Deleting pages is a common task for many reasons, including:

- **Cleaning Up Documents:** Removing unnecessary pages, such as blank pages or irrelevant sections, makes your document more professional.
- **Reducing File Size:** Fewer pages mean a smaller file size, which is easier to email or upload.
- **Privacy and Security:** You can remove pages containing sensitive or confidential information before sharing a document with others.
