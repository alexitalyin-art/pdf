Scanned documents or files from different sources often have pages that are incorrectly oriented—sideways or even completely upside down. While many PDF viewers let you temporarily rotate the view, this change isn't saved. To fix the orientation permanently, you need a dedicated tool.

This guide will show you how to easily rotate one or all pages in your PDF and save the corrected version for free.

## When Do You Need to Rotate a PDF?

Fixing page orientation is a common and necessary task, especially when:

- **Working with Scans:** Scanners often save pages in the wrong orientation, especially when dealing with mixed portrait and landscape documents.
- **Correcting Export Errors:** Some software can export PDFs with incorrect page rotation.
- **Improving Readability:** Ensuring all pages are upright makes the document easy to read for anyone you share it with.
