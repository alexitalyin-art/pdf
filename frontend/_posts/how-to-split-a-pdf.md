Whether you have a large PDF report and only need to share a single chapter, or you want to separate a batch of scanned invoices into individual files, splitting a PDF is a common and useful task. While it sounds technical, the process is incredibly simple with the right online tool.

This guide will show you how to split any PDF file securely, right in your browser, without needing any special software.

## When Do You Need to Split a PDF?

Splitting a PDF is useful in many situations, such as:

- **Sharing Specific Sections:** Sending just one chapter of a book or one section of a report without sending the entire large file.
- **Extracting Important Pages:** Saving only the most important pages from a long document, like a contract's signature page.
- **Organizing Scans:** Separating a single file containing multiple scanned documents (like invoices or receipts) into individual files.

## How to Split a PDF in 4 Easy Steps

The **A2Z Tool** platform offers a free and secure way to split your PDF files by specifying the exact pages you need.

1.  **Upload Your PDF:** Navigate to our [Split PDF tool](/en/split) and upload your document. Your file remains private as it's processed directly in your browser.
2.  **Review Your Document:** Use the page slider to look through your PDF and decide which pages you want to extract.
3.  **Enter Page Ranges:** In the text box, type the page numbers or ranges you want in your new file. You can be very specific, for example:
    - To get just page 5, type `5`.
    - To get pages 2 through 5, type `2-5`.
    - To get pages 1, 3, and 8, type `1, 3, 8`.
    - You can even combine them: `1, 3-5, 8`.
4.  **Split and Download:** Click the "Split PDF" button. Your new PDF, containing only the pages you selected, will be created instantly for you to download.

This process gives you complete control over your documents, allowing you to create smaller, more focused PDFs from larger files quickly and easily.
