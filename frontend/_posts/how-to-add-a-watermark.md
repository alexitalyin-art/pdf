Adding a watermark to a PDF is a professional way to protect your documents, assert ownership, or indicate the status of a file (e.g., "Confidential," "Draft," "Sample"). While this sounds like a feature in expensive software, you can do it for free, right in your browser.

This guide will show you how to add a custom watermark to any PDF in just a few clicks.

## Why Add a Watermark to Your PDF?

Watermarks are a powerful tool for document management. Common uses include:

- **Copyright Protection:** Placing your name or company name on your work prevents unauthorized use.
- **Document Status:** Clearly label documents as "Draft," "Confidential," "For Review," or "Approved."
- **Branding:** Add your company name or website to every page of a document for consistent branding.
