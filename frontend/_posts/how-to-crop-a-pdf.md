PDF documents often come with large white margins, especially after scanning, or they might contain headers and footers you wish to remove. Cropping a PDF allows you to trim the edges of your pages to focus on the essential content, creating a cleaner and more professional-looking document.

This guide will show you how to visually crop your PDF pages online, without needing any expensive software.

## Why Crop a PDF?

Cropping is a powerful editing feature used to:

- **Remove White Margins:** Get rid of unnecessary white space around your content, making it easier to read on smaller screens.
- **Hide Unwanted Elements:** Trim away headers, footers, or side notes that are not relevant to the final document.
- **Focus on a Specific Area:** Isolate a single chart, image, or section of a page to create a more focused view.
- **Prepare for Printing:** Adjust the page dimensions to fit specific printing requirements.
