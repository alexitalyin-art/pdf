                <p>
                    In a world where simple tasks often require expensive software or surrendering your privacy, A2Z Tool was created with a clear mission: to provide powerful, easy-to-use PDF tools that are completely free and respect your data. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to manage their documents without barriers.

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                  A2Z Tool was started by a solo developer who was frustrated with the state of online PDF tools. Too many sites were slow, covered in ads, or required you to upload sensitive files to their servers. We decided to build a better alternativeâ€”a single, reliable website where the tools are powerful and your privacy is guaranteed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thank you for using A2Z Tool. We're committed to building the best free document tools on the web, and we're just getting started.
                </p>
